<h3>Assignment Aim</h3>
<p>The assignment has 4 parts:</p>
<p><ul>1.  It aims to give students an understanding of how computer systems represent real-life data
     such as positive, negative numbers, floating point numbers, text, etc., at the lowest level
     seen by the programmer, namely binary numbers. </ul></p>
<p><ul>2.  It prepares students with the ability to install multiple operations systems using Virtual
    Box (https://www.virutalbox.org/) and comparatively evaluate the Linux/UNIX Operating systems
    (OS). This assignment also prepares students to understand the basic concepts covering Linux/UNIX 
    file systems, commands, and working environments.</ul></p>
<p><ul>3.  It helps students understand the basic idea of contemporary Machine Learning and
    Deep Learning using Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/).</ul></p>
<p><ul>4. It aims to have students demonstrate an awareness of enterprise information systems,
    their application in the business environment, and modelling techniques for systems
    requirements:</ul></p>
<p><ul><ul>a. It prepares students with the ability to analyse business cases and document
    the purpose, objectives, data requirements, data flows, input documents and
    output documents of common business functions and processes expressed in a
    range of information systems.</ul></ul></p>

<h3>Machine Learning and Deep Learning</h3>
<p>This part of the assignment will help you to understand the basic idea of Machine Learning and Deep
    Learning using Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/ ). You will experiment with running
    a YOLO Python file on Google Colab and evaluate the results of your experiment.</p>

<br>

<p>Here you will test a fast version of an available object detection system - YOLO
    (https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). You will submit photos (taken by yourself) to YOLO; YOLO will
    try to identify the objects in the photos and will tag the objects and produce accuracy percentages of
    the detection/prediction. You will analyse the results to conclude if the tool is good enough for your
    task </p>
<p>In the following section, we provide an overview of the process, followed by the questions you need
    to work through.</p>
<h4>An overview - Using YOLO with Google Colab</h4>
<p><ul>1) Download the attached file: Assignment_1.ipynb from the Assessment page.</ul></p>
<p><ul>2) Open Google Colab: https://colab.research.google.com/ and login (using a gmail
    account)</ul></p>
    <ul><img src = "images/image002.jpg"></ul>
<p><ul>3) Click File >> Upload Note Book to upload the .ipynb file</ul></p>
<p><ul>4) You will see only two cells of code. Click Run cell (se figure below) to run each cell.
    You will need to run the first cell once, and the last cell many times to finish the
    assignment):</ul></p>
    <p><ul><ul>- 1st cell: where you can get the Yolo repo, pre-trained weights and set up the
        python environment (You only need to run this cell once)</ul></ul></p>
    <p><ul><ul>- 2nd cell: where you upload the necessary photos/images (.jpg) from your local
        drive to achieve prediction with YOLO</ul></ul></p>
    <ul><img src = "images/image003.jpg"></ul>
<p><ul>5) When you run cell 2, the program waits for you to upload a file. Click on Choose a file
    and select a file from your dataset of photos.</ul></p>
<p><ul>6) YOLO will then try to identify the objects in the photo and will give you the prediction
    results and percentage of accuracy of the prediction.</ul></p>
<p><ul>The output could be something like this:</ul></p>
<ul><img src = "images/image004.jpg"></ul>
<p><ul>And here, 1 person and 3 dogs are successfully detected in the image.</ul></p>

<h4><u>Question 1: Collect dataset / photos</u>(10 marks)</h4>
<p><ul>- Take at least 10 photos that include animals, people or groups of other objects. You may use
    your cell phone to take the pictures or find them on the internet.</ul></p>
<p><ul>- Save all the pictures to a folder called Images</ul></p>
<p><ul>- You may wish to resize the images so that each is 500 KB or less in size</ul></p>

<h4><u>Question 2: Test the prediction performance of YOLO object detection system using images
    as the inputs </u>(10 marks)</h4>

<p><ul>- Start by running the first cell to set up the environment (you only need to run it once).</ul></p>
<ul><img src = "images/image006.jpg"></ul>

<p><ul>- Run the second cell and click “Choose Files” to upload a jpg image.</ul></p>
<ul><img src = "images/image007.jpg"></ul>

<p><ul>- After that, you will first see the weights being downloaded; and then the object detection
    system will search for all objects in the image and return output with bounding boxes and
    annotations of detected objects like in the following image:</ul></p>
<ul><img src = "images/image008.jpg"></ul>
<ul><img src = "images/image009.jpg"></ul>
